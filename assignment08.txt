Assignment 8:
Implementation:
- Removed base, bound
- Physical Addresses are now retrieved from the page table if they exist.
  Otherwise a new frame is allocated and mapped in the pageTable (falloc).
- Created free list for free memory frames. Is not an external list, but
  the first memory entry in every frame contains the address of the next
  frame.
  First free frame is pointed to using a free pointer.
- Every process has an own pagetable. The pagetable address for each process
  saved in the process's processTable entry.

What works:
- paging mechanism works.
- Frame allocation works. No used frames are reallocated or overwritten.

Problems:
- Not enough time
- syscalls somehow not handled correctly
